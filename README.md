# ⚡ Titan-Zero-Project: Elite v4.2 (Apex Legends)
**Advanced Neural-Network Scripts for Titan Two & Cronus Zen. Undetected 2026.**

---

## 🚀 Overview
The Titan-Zero Project offers the world's most sophisticated bypass for competitive shooters. Optimized for **288 Hz High-End setups**, our scripts communicate directly with the Titan-Processor to ensure a 0.0ms input delay and a total bypass of EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat).

## 📥 Installation-Guide: Titan-Zero Elite v4.2

### Step 1: Hardware Preparation
* **Connect** your Titan adapter to your PC and ensure that the firmware is up to date.
* **Enable** “Communication Method: USB” mode in your console settings to halve the input lag.
* **Plug** your controller into the Front-Port A of the Titan Two for native signal processing.

### Step 2: Script Injection & Setup
* **Download** the `Elite_Titan_Config_v4.zip` from this repository.
* **Drag & Drop** the `.gpc` file into Slot 1 of your device memory.
* **Configuration:** Set your Ingame-Sensitivity to **"7-4 Classic"** or **"Linear"**. Our Neural-Recoil algorithm is calibrated to these values for 100% precision.

### Step 3: In-Game Activation
1.  Enter a match and wait until you are in the **Dropship**.
2.  Press **L1 + R1 + D-Pad DOWN** (or LB + RB + D-Pad DOWN) simultaneously.
3.  A short **vibration** confirms that the Kernel-Level-Bypass is active.
4.  The script now uses **Real-Time Weapon Detection** to eliminate recoil for any weapon you pick up (Flatline, Havoc, R-99, Nemesis).

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
* **Issue:** Recoil is still active? 
* **Fix:** Open the `Troubleshoot_ReadMe.txt` file inside the ZIP-folder for the manual override key.
* **Issue:** Device disconnects?
* **Fix:** Ensure you are using a high-speed USB 3.0 cable to support the 288 Hz polling rate.
